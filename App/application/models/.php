Never in my life did I think one night could incorporate Spiderman, Madonna, The Masksss, Michael Jackson, the YMCA and Jesus. But that just scratches the surface of my&amp;nbsp;evening at Coco Bongo!

When I booked my holiday to Cancun the one place everyone recommended was ‘Coco Bongo’ – a club that apparently puts Vegas to shame. So, on the second last night of my vacation we decided to make it one to remember. Myself, my friend and the random but undeniably wonderful group of people we’d met on holiday bought our tickets to Coco Bongo (after a lengthy period of bargaining on what was apparently a ‘set-price which simply could not be reduced’… funny what a bit of bartering can do).
</p>
<p>
So, after getting glammed up, practically spitting out a margarita (who seriously likes drinking salt?) and downing an inevitable shot or two which seemed to come hand-in-hand with my new friend Johan, we all headed to Coco Bongo. Hello massive queue! Now, the woman who I’d been bargaining with earlier had agreed to take us to Coco Bongo and get us in straight away. No, no, no - we would make our own way there I’d told her. Well didn’t I feel stupid when she and her group of followers walked right past us into the club!

Never mind, usually I’d hate waiting, but the endless array of tequila shots and vodka cranberry made it a lot easier. That, and watching my friend getting picked up by Spiderman – priceless! Oh, and I “conquered” my childhood fear too. By that I mean I didn’t go running off like a baby. I’ve been scared of The Mask since I dreamt he kidnapped me from school and hung me on the wall in a bin bag. Talk about an overactive imagination! Anyway there he was, only this time he had a friend – The Mexican Mask. I’m sure he was meant to be the friendly version, but that green face and scarily sarcastic grin is plain freaky if you ask me!

Once we got into the club we headed to the balcony, until I had brilliant idea number two – I wanted to be in amongst the action downstairs. So I led the way with a group of nine behind me. The phrase ‘a tin of sardines’ comes to mind. Despite finding a good spot on the stairs I had managed to lose seven people. So, me, Marcel and Gemma stayed put for a while and enjoyed the fascinating productions. The Rise of Jesus was a real highlight for me. The aerobatic performance was intense and dramatic – trust me, Coco Bongo is something else! Even the Madonna and Michael Jackson performances are incredible, and I’m never the sort of person to sit in a pub on holiday and watch a fat middle aged man take on Elvis.

Gemma, being a holiday rep, had seen the show a million times before so decided to go and find the others. Me, needing a wee, decided to follow a little while later only to get the third degree for leaving my friend (with other people mind you). Handsome Dutch man or the girl I have woken up next to for the past seven days? I rest my case.

So, whilst we let the club die down a bit, we all spent some time together in the adjoining bar. Who cares what production we were missing? It doesn’t matter what beautiful country you are visiting in my opinion; the people you meet are what truly make your vacation. And these people had made my holiday one that would take a while to get over. We finished our night watching the fantastic Spiderman and Green Goblin production and then I played the role of sleepy-drunk dancing away eyes half-shut holding a glow stick.
</p>
<p>
It was time to leave, but the night wasn’t over yet. What’s that I see when I leave the club? Subway! Yes, I did the traditionally English thing of getting excited over a fast food place I could go to every day of the week if I really wanted to. But I was drunk, so I’m forgiven.
</p>
<p>
After eating half of the sandwich like it was my last supper, missing my mouth with the rest (yes, I’m such an attractive drunk) and watching some random man attempt to go for a wee on an invisible toilet by the side of Subway, we headed home. A bus journey filled with young boys making rude gestures was the only thing left to endure. But they were harmless really and I was too tired to care. The end to an incredible night, the end of a memorable holiday, but the beginning of new friendships and a thumping hangover!
